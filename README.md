# Ishtar
  This project is from the HackUPC Hackathon and tries to bring a product delivery system from a storage without the client interacting with the system. 
  
  To accomplish this it uses:
  - Whisper to transform voice to text
  - NPL to detect the aim of the query. 
  - NPL to detect the product (Does not work correctly).
  - google translate api to answer the client (Logic implemented but not present in the frontend).
